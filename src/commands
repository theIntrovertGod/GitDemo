git ignore: git ignore are those files, which you do not want to track.

git branch

--branching:
git branch: it will show your current branch + the available branches

git branch engineSizeComparator
-- branch name should also indicate what you are doing that branch

git branch <branchName>

git checkout -b <branchName>

git checkout <branchName>

if you want to merge a branch on current branch
git merge <branchName>

master to-> feature branch (FB)
git checkout -b <branchName> : this will create the branch and move to the new branch

is Git of any benefit if it remains in the local itself?

done with version control, now another big part of git is collaboration

for that we need something called as cloud repository or remote repository

We can connect out local git repo with multiple remote repos
In general its only 1 remote repo per local repo (people create multiple for backup)

"name of remote repo[key]" => "link"

the very first entry that you create for remote repo is origin,
the name of the key is called origin

key-> origin

git remote add origin <link>
